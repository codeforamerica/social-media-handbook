					<h1>Why use social media?</h1>
					<div>
					            <p>It’s fast, it’s viral, it can spark civic engagement, and it’s free.</p>
											<p>Social media helps cities in their core mission of reaching more constituents to more broadly share government information and activities.  There are more than 900 million users on Facebook and more than 600 million users on Twitter.  It’s the quickest, cheapest way to communicate and interact with your community.</p>
											<p>The benefits of using social media are evident: you can write in common language, raise awareness and participation in municipal activities, and build a stronger community.  Social media can also increase government transparency, and it allows you to communicate directly with residents.</p>
					          </div>
					          <div>
					  					<h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
					  						<p>Social media does not replace traditional means of communication, rather it should be used to supplement standard methods.</p>
					  						<p>Don’t use social media just to use social media.  Have a reason and a message to communicate. Pick and choose the platforms you wish to use, and use them loyally.  It’s better to use one or two platforms regularly and well, than multiple networks infrequently and poorly.</p>
					  						<p>Try to keep the number of accounts per platform at a minimum. The more accounts you have, the more you segment your own community and minimize your reach.  There are exceptions to the rule, however.  Well-known city programs, events, or places that are associated with the city but have no immediate logical affiliation with the city in the minds of citizens, can in fact have a separate account.  Examples include Zoos, Beaches, Parks, etc.</p>
					  						<p>Don’t use social media if you simply want to broadcast your message;  it’s a conversation, and you have to participate by both providing information and listening to feedback.</p>

					      	<div class="top_art_cont">
					      		<p>With more than 900 million active users, Facebook is the most widely-used social networking platform in the world. Facebook helps cities connect with residents and build community online. Facebook fanpages are used by many municipal governments to provide residents with information about government services and projects, local events, rules and regulations, and other relevant topics. It’s also a forum to engage in a dialogue with residents, garner feedback, and strengthen relationships with the community.</p>
					          <p>There is one primary Facebook page for the City and County of Honolulu: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/honolulu.gov">facebook.com/Honolulu.Gov</a>.</p>
					      		<p>Here are two examples of city fanpages done well: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SF">City and County of San Francisco</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nycgov">City of New York</a>. </p>

                            <li><span class="arrows">></span> The “Timeline” is a collection of photos, updates, and interactions between you and your community.  This is where you add content to share with your fans. </li>
                            <li><span class="arrows">></span> The “News Feed” is an aggregate of updates from other organizations, businesses, and people that you have selected to follow.  You can share these messages with your own followers by clicking on “Share."</li>

					      		       <ul>
					      		       	<li><span class="arrows">></span> It's important to “Like” other city pages, as well as community groups and members, organizations, local businesses, and news outlets.  This is how you learn what's going on in your city, gain followers, and build an online community.</li>
					      						<li><span class="arrows">></span> Share photos, videos, information, news articles and other relevant information with the public using the "Share" menu visible from your Timeline.</li>

					      				<h6>Post a variety of content</h6>
					      					<ul>
					      						<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don't rely exclusively on text or photos; mix up the content mediums.  Rotate through text, articles, video, and photos. </li>
					      						<li><span class="arrows">></span> Make your posts informative and fun. Post street closures and upcoming fairs or festivals.  Post a picture from a press conference and from a parade.</li>
					      					</ul>
					              <h6>Your individual URL</h6>
					              	<ul>

					<li><span class="arrows">></span> Notifications will be sent to each party being tagged.</li>
					<li><span class="arrows">></span> Tagging shares your post or photo with the networks of those you have identified, allowing for broader visibility.</li>

					            				<li><span class="arrows">></span> Pictures garner high visibility on Facebook and often prompt more interaction than any other type of posting.</li>
					            				<li><span class="arrows">></span> Remember, interacting is not only a great way to build community, but it also makes your city's residents feel that their opinion matters.</li>
					            				<li><span class="arrows">></span> When someone posts to your timeline and is looking for a response, respond.  It's called "social" media after all!</li>
					<li><span class="arrows">></span> Use Facebook’s built-in analytics, accessible via the admin panel, to get a better idea about which content is driving traffic and shared most.  Use the learning to share more inspiring content.</li>

					                    <li><span class="arrows">></span> Be consistent in tone but varied in content.  No one wants just pictures or only text.  Mix it up.</li>
					                    <li><span class="arrows">></span> Work to post a similar number of content items each day.  Minimum, one!  But remember, over-posting content will only annoy your fans and cause them to "unlike" your page or hide your content from their news feeds.</li>

										<p>Twitter is one of the most frequented social media networks in existence today.  It's designed to instantly connect users to what's most important:  you can follow other cities, local business, community leaders, and news outlets.  The nature of the platform is viral — individuals passing along one another's comments to their own networks — making it one of the quickest, easiest methods to broadcast information to an expansive audience.<br /> 
										<p>There is one primary Twitter account for the City and County of Honolulu: <a href="http://twitter.com/honolulugov">twitter.com/HonoluluGov</a></p>
                    <p> Here is an example of a city that uses Twitter well: <a href="https://es.twitter.com/PhiladelphiaGov">@PhiladelphiaGov</a></li>

											<h6><span class="numbers">1.</span> Go to <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter.com</a></h6>
											<h6><span class="numbers">2.</span> Log in;  or if you don't have an account, create one</h6>
												<ul>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> If you don't already have a Twitter account (also known as a "handle"), create one.  Note: the more Twitter handles you have publishing content, the less effective your overall communication.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Create a username:  it should be easily identifiable, include city name in it (shorten if possible), and the word "gov" or "city".</li> 
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Be consistent.  Try to use the same username throughout all social media.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> An “ @ ” will be added to the front of the name and will always be included as part of the handle.  <i>Example: <a href="https://twitter.com/HonoluluGov">@HonoluluGov</a></i>.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> You will be prompted to build your profile by following others, making your profile searchable by category, and adding character (an image and bio) to your profile. (You have the option to skip this if needed; you can always do this later).</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> A verification email will be sent your primary email address.   Click the link in the email to confirm your account.</li>	
					              </ul>
											<h6><span class="numbers">3.</span> Edit your profile</h6>
					              <ul>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> If you already have a Twitter account, ensure that your name or handle is easy to recognize, and sounds official.</li>
					  <li><span class="arrows">></span> At any point, you can change your handle to a more readable, credible, and easily identifiable name while maintaining all your current followers and posts. <i>Example: instead of @HNL_info, use @CityofHNL or @HonoluluGov.</i></li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Your profile description should include the words "official" and "government" to ensure that viewers are aware that you are providing official city information.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Your profile should also include a link to the city or city department website, as well as a link to the complete list of Twitter accounts and hashtags used by the city.</li>

										<h3 class="ribbon">The Fundamentals</h3>  
											<h6>Understand the landscape</h6>			
												<ul>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> With Twitter, you create tweets to share information with the public and follow others to stay informed.</li>
                          <li><span class="arrows">></span> Each user has his or her own page, which can be found at <a href="https://twitter.com/username">twitter.com/<i>username</i></a>. This page displays tweets of those you are following, and space to create a tweet on the upper left.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Tweets are no more than 140 characters long.  They can contain links.</li>
                           <li><span class="arrows">></span> It's important to follow other community groups, community members, local businesses, organizations, governments, and news outlets.</li>
                          <li><span class="arrows">></span> It's important to not only follow others but to retweet their content to your followers and reply to their posts.</li>
												</ul>
											<h6>Twitter tricks</h6>	
												<ul>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Use shortlinks. You can shorten links at <a href="http://bitly.com">bit.ly</a> or <a href="http://go.usa.gov">go.usa.gov</a>.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Although Twitter automatically shortens links, using <a href="http://bitly.com">bit.ly</a> or other URL shorteners to tweet a shortlink is best practice because <a href="http://bitly.com">bit.ly</a> also enables you to track and analyze your links.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Direct messaging: allows you to privately communicate with a follower (only with those users that follow you).</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Retweeting: shares someone else’s tweet with your followers.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Hashtags: The “ # ” symbol, called a hashtag, is used to categorize messages and associated themes.</li>
												</ul>
											<h6>Sample tweet</h6>  
												<ul>
													<li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/honolulufest">@honolulufest</a> begins today. Join us downtown from 10-5 for <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23hula">#hula</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23locomoco">#LocoMoco</a> and festivities! <a href="http://bit.ly/OKCyzk">http://bit.ly/OKCyzk</a></li>

					        <div class="program_cont row" id="tactic-twt"> 		
										<h3 class="ribbon">Tactics</h3>  
					            <h6>Minimize accounts</h6> 
					              <ul>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Keep active Twitter accounts to a minimum. Multiple Twitter accounts will only fragment your audience, and the community of followers you wish to develop won’t be attainable unless account consolidation occurs.</li> 
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> A new Twitter account or handle should only be created if there is a logical disconnection between the entity and the city, such as a zoo.  Or if a department draws a specific, dedicated, yet broad audience that is keen on being kept up-to-date on the departmental functions, such as the police department.</li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Instead of multiple Twitter accounts, use hashtags for topics.</li>
					              </ul>
					            <h6>Build your community</h6>
					              <ul>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Follow others.  It's an easy way to get more people to follow you and grow your impression.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Retweet often.  You want people to retweet you, so retweet them.  It's a good way to build social capital.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Tweet a variety of topics and media.  Tweet information and notifications, as well as news articles, photos, and less formal comments.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Share video from your YouTube channel or pictures from Flickr. (View the Flickr &amp; YouTube sections for instructions).</li>
					              </ul>

					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t start tweets with “ @ ” unless you're tweeting <i>at someone</i>. These are considered a <i>reply</i> and are not displayed to as broad of an audience, and look like an internal conversation which will get ignored.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Use hashtags as often as possible.  This allows for broader awareness of your message.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Create hashtags for a given topic or event such as the Honolulu Pride Parade (#hnlpride).  Promote and get your community to use it as well.
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Garner responses by explicitly promoting a hashtag.  <i>Example: “What do you think of the new play structure at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23Kilaueapark">#KilaueaPark</a>?  Include <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23Kilaueapark">#KilaueaPark</a> in reply.”</i></li>

					              <ul>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> When you tweet at someone, use their Twitter handle (name) at the beginning of the tweet.  This allows for minimal viewing and indicates that you are speaking directly to that person.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Reply when mentioned or tweeted at.  It's called “social” media after all!</li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don't enable the setting to post your tweets to Facebook.  You don't want all your 140-character tweets cluttering up your Facebook news feed.  They are different media, intended to be used differently.</li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> You can post pictures by emailing them to a special email address that's designated for your account.  Write any text in the subject of the email.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Keep your messages short and simple.  You don't have to use all 140 characters.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Learn the lingo.  <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/Twitter_Dictionary_Guide.asp">Look up the shorthand</a>.</li>

					                  <li><span class="arrows">></span> Tags are words to identify the picture. <i>Examples: Town Hall, June 2012, City of Honolulu, The Greenhouse.</i> </li>
					                  <li><span class="arrows">></span> Tagging photos is very important.  It allows for images and sets to easily be found in searches.  Whenever someone searches Flickr using a keyword, Flickr aggregates all the images tagged with that keyword.</li>

								<div class="program_cont row">
									<h3 class="ribbon">Overall</h3>
									<ul>
                    <li><span class="arrows">></span> The point of social media is to easily share information with a community of people and to be able to broadcast messages to a broader audience than you can through other means.</li>
                    <li><span class="arrows">></span> Designate who the primary person(s) will be to manage the account.</li>
                    <li><span class="arrows">></span> For those using an existing profile with multiple account managers, designate a centralized location for logins and passwords.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Promote! Place the Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social account information on business cards, websites, press releases, blogs, and any other locations that can drive traffic.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Ask questions and try to encourage responses from your social communities.  Make your networks a valuable resource for information and insight.</li>
                    <li><span class="arrows">></span> In general, messaging can be either public or private; private messaging should be minimized and only used when necessary.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Share everything from press releases and official statements to breaking news and city-wide announcements.</li> 
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Social implies a two-way street. Be sure to respond to postings, comments, or tweets in a timely manner.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Residents view Social Media as a platform to gain insight into city government and to contribute their voice.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> If you have any questions, or don’t understand something, Google it.</li> 
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> If content is shared that is inappropriate or off-message, delete it if no one responded to it. If it has been noticed, apologize and correct it, don’t just quietly delete it.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Share your content across all networks, but be sure to tailor the message for each specific network.</li>							
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Social Media can be used in addition to existing emergency notification systems, like Honolulu's <a href="http://www.honolulupd.org/info/nixle.htm">Nixle</a>. This is a quick and highly effective way to share important messages, PSA’s, and breaking news with your community.</li>
									</ul>	
								
								<h3 class="ribbon">Frequency</h3>  
								<ul >
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Timeliness is key. For events or gatherings, post updates throughout to keep people immediately informed.</li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t overwhelm others by over-posting: people will become fatigued and you will lose fans/followers.</li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t repeat the same message more than once: it will overwhelm and annoy your audience. </li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t become obsolete due to lack of sharing of new information. Try to update your networks a minimum of once per day.</li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t post just because you can; only share things worth sharing.</li>
                </ul>
								
								<h3 class="ribbon">Tone of Voice</h3>  
								<ul>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Create messages that will inspire others to share, like, and comment. The goal is to get your messages reposted and retweeted: this will help the word spread and reach many more people.</li> 
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Be casual and engaging, not authoritative and distant.</li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Active voice is better than passive voice.</li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> <i>Example: instead of “Advisory Message: Motorists are urged to avoid Keeaumoku Street in Honolulu”, write “Avoid Keeaumoku Street while driving.”</i></li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Speak colloquially and use diction that is easy to understand.</li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Stay consistent, try to keep a similar style and language for each post.</li>
                  <li><span class="arrows">></span> Minimize the mentioning of acronyms unless it is already widely understood. For example, many people may not know that “MOCA” stands for “Mayor’s Office of Culture and the Arts.”  If you are unsure whether to abbreviate or not, it’s probably best to spell it out.</li>
                  <li><span class="arrows">></span> If a place, person, or organization you're mentioning in your tweet has a Twitter handle, use that Twitter handle in place of the name.  It both notifies them, and shows your social media adeptness and friendliness.</li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Keep it short and stick to the point.</li>
                </ul>
								
								<h3 class="ribbon">Unique Approaches</h3>  
								  <ul>	
								    <li><span class="arrows">></span> Organize tweetups (in-person meetups) and Twitter chats (organized chats through Twitter around a #hashtag).  <i>Examples:</i>
